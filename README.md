# super-goggles
a RESTful Spring Boot API for tracking expenses.

This is my starter RESTful API written in Java Spring Boot framework with PostgreSQL database.

In this project, I have tried to use JWT authentication token to authenticate user to the system.

This project is on progress,

**wish me luck :)**
